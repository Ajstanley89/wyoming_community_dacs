      <li><strong>Groundwater Protection:</strong> All operations are designed to avoid impacts to drinking water sources, with monitoring aligned to EPA Class VI injection well standards.</li>
      <li><strong>Site Selection:</strong> Locations were chosen to avoid high-stress water basins and minimize ecological impact.</li>
      <li><strong>Regulatory Compliance:</strong> Full alignment with Wyoming DEQ and federal water permitting frameworks ensures responsible stewardship.</li>
    </ul>

      <h2>Wildlife Protection</h2>
      <p>This section explains how Summit Air minimizes its impact on Wyoming’s ecosystems by integrating wildlife protection into every phase of project planning and operations.</p>
    </header>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Low-Impact Siting:</strong> Project facilities are located to avoid critical habitats and migration corridors for native species such as pronghorn, mule deer, and sage-grouse.</li>
      <li><strong>Seasonal Timing Restrictions:</strong> Construction and maintenance activities are scheduled to minimize disruption during nesting, calving, and breeding periods.</li>
      <li><strong>Habitat Buffer Zones:</strong> Designated protective buffers are established around key wildlife areas, reducing noise and light pollution impacts.</li>
      <li><strong>Collaborative Planning:</strong> Summit Air works with local wildlife biologists, landowners, and agencies to guide responsible development.</li>
      <li><strong>Post-Construction Monitoring:</strong> Ongoing ecological surveys ensure that conservation goals are met and adaptive strategies are implemented as needed.</li>
    </ul>

      <h2>Secure CO₂ Storage</h2>
      <p>This section describes how Summit Air ensures the safe, permanent storage of captured CO₂ in deep geologic formations, using proven methods and rigorous oversight.</p>
    </header>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Class VI Well Compliance:</strong> Storage wells are designed and permitted under EPA Class VI regulations, with strict controls for long-term containment.</li>
      <li><strong>Geologic Suitability:</strong> Target formations are selected for their natural ability to trap CO₂, including thick impermeable caprock layers and deep saline aquifers.</li>
      <li><strong>Seismic and Subsurface Modeling:</strong> Advanced 3D geophysical modeling and simulation tools guide well placement and CO₂ plume tracking.</li>
      <li><strong>Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV):</strong> Real-time pressure sensors, seismic surveys, and groundwater testing provide continuous assurance of storage integrity.</li>
      <li><strong>Long-Term Stewardship:</strong> Summit Air works with state and federal agencies to ensure post-injection site care, including bonding and closure planning.</li>
